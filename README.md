# AarogyaAI---A-poplicy-Sandbox
It is a place where  you can simulate and test your policies over a span of 30 years on 50000+ AI agents and know how the Indian population would react to it. This project utilizes Genetic Algorithm (GA) guided by trained models (random forest) to mutate multiple policies and then tweak those policies to find out which suits our agents the best.
